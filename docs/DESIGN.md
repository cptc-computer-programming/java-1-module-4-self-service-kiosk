# Design: Self-Service Kiosk

## Kiosk Purpose
Describe what your kiosk does and who it is for.

Example:
“This kiosk allows users to check in for a gym class and prints a confirmation.”

---

## User Interaction Flow
In 3–5 steps, describe how a user interacts with your kiosk.

Example:
1. User is greeted
2. User enters their name
3. User enters a class or item
4. Program displays a summary

---

## Objects Used
List three example objects your program will use.

For each object, describe:
- what it represents
- what information it remembers (state)
- what actions you will ask it to perform (methods)

### Example format

`Scanner`
- Represents: user input
- Remembers: input source and current position
- Methods used: nextLine, nextInt

`String (name)`
- Represents: user’s name
- Remembers: characters of the name
- Methods used: trim, toUpperCase, length

Include your extra object here as well. 

---

## Methods Overview
List the main methods your program will have and what each one is responsible for. Note: this should be briefer than last week's Shipping Quote method breakdown.

Example:
- `getUserInfo`: handles input
- `processData`: processes Strings and values
- `printSummary`: displays final output

---

## Design Notes
Briefly explain any design choices you made.

Examples:
- Why you separated input and output
- Why you chose certain objects or methods
- Anything you are unsure about yet

This section can be short.
